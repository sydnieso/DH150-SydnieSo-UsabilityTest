### Usability Test - Sydnie So DH 150

#### Purpose of Usability Testing
Through this test I aim to gain insight on how well users can navigate the application Charity Miles. Through a heuristic evaluation, I discovered that the biggest issue is the icons on the navigation bar. These icons are not easily decipherable and do not follow the recognition rather than recall trait. This causes users to have to remember what each icon means rather than being able to easily identify them based on their look. This will be tested based on asking a series of questions as to what page the user would think each icon leads to. 

Another issue that this usability test will address is the consistency and standards of the application. Throughout the app there are various images and words that appear as if they would be clickable buttons, providing more information. In order to test the user and determine the severity of this issue, I will ask them to click on where they think they could find more information about their selected charity. 

Finally, a third issue I discovered was the lack of control and freedom the user has. If a user were to accidentally start an activity and wanted to cancel it, there is no option to do so, instead the user has to indicated ‘finishing’ the activity. To test if this is confusing to other users, I will ask them to start an activity and attempt to cancel it after changing their mind.

#### Takeaways
Through this usability test I learned that I need to be more well prepared with my materials. Overall the usability test went well, because the user pointed out many of the flaws that I believed were present in the app as well. There were some technical issues that caused my screenrecording to end without me knowing, which led to a pause in what was a well flowing conversation with the user. In the future I would improve the screen recording software that I chose to use on my phone, because it is not clear as to which buttons the user is selecting (which is why I asked the user to verbally say what was being clicked). This software also stopped recording without half way through the session which I would hope to prevent in the future by periodically checking that the recording is still in session.

**Note:**
I conducted an additional test after the recording failed during my first test. The second video is linked below. To know the different answers connected to the online survey, this user signed with the initials MM.
