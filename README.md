### Usability Test - Sydnie So DH 150

#### Purpose of Usability Testing
Through this test I aim to gain insight on how well users can naviagte the application Charity Miles. Through a heuristic evaluation, I discovered that the biggest issue is the icons on the navigation bar. These icons are not easily decipherable and do not follow the recognition rather than recall trait. This causes users to have to remember what each icon means rather than being able to easily identify them based on their look. This will be tested based on asking a series of questions as to what page the user would think each icon leads to.
