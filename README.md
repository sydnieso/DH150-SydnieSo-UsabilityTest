### Usability Test - Sydnie So DH 150

#### Purpose of Usability Testing
Through this test I aim to gain insight on how well users can navigate the application Charity Miles. Through a heuristic evaluation, I discovered that the biggest issue is the icons on the navigation bar. These icons are not easily decipherable and do not follow the recognition rather than recall trait. This causes users to have to remember what each icon means rather than being able to easily identify them based on their look. This will be tested based on asking a series of questions as to what page the user would think each icon leads to. 

Another issue that this usability test will address is the consistency and standards of the application. Throughout the app there are various images and words that appear as if they would be clickable buttons, providing more information. In order to test the user and determine the severity of this issue, I will ask them to click on where they think they could find more information about their selected charity. 

Finally, a third issue I discovered was the lack of control and freedom the user has. If a user were to accidentally start an activity and wanted to cancel it, there is no option to do so, instead the user has to indicated ‘finishing’ the activity. To test if this is confusing to other users, I will ask them to start an activity and attempt to cancel it after changing their mind.
